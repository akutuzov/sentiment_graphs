Sentiment Graphs
==============

Fine-grained sentiment is often handled in a pipeline setting, breaking the larger task of extracting opinion tuples into sub-tasks.

We propose to cast the fine-grained sentiment analysis problem as semantic graph parsing. This brings the sentiment problem in line with other tasks, such as dependency parsing, semantic parsing, or negation scope resolution and enables us to take advantage of these annotations to improve the accuracy of our sentiment parser.
